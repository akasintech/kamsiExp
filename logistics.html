            <p>Local carriers, often referred to as second carriers, are transportation companies operating within United State that KamsiExpress collaborates with to facilitate deliveries to customers located outside United State. KamsiExpress handles shipping and customs clearance exclusively to our United State office, where customers are responsible for picking up their shipments.</p><br>
            <p>To provide a more comprehensive service, we can arrange for your shipment to be forwarded to any city of your choice using local carriers. Please note, however, that once we hand over your shipment to the local carrier, KamsiExpress relinquishes responsibility for it. After this point, the shipment will be transported according to the specific terms and conditions set forth by the local carrier. Any issues that arise regarding delays, damage, or loss will need to be resolved directly between the customer and the transportation company.</p><br><br>
            <p>The charges for this forwarding service vary based on the destination of the shipment, so it's important to inquire about the specific pricing for your intended location.</p><br><br>
            <p>Additionally, we would like to inform our customers that KamsiExpress reserves the right to decline requests for certain optional services at any time if necessary, even if payment has already been made for those services. Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.</p>
