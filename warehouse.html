            <p>KamsiExpress provides a complimentary storage service for shipment in our warehouse located in the USA and all Countries, allowing for a maximum duration of seven calendar days. During this period, there are no storage fees.</p><br><br>
            <p>For shipments arriving at our USA office, we expect them to be shipped out within seven days. This ensures efficient processing and minimizes delays. Similarly, for Shipments delivered to our other Countries, we request that they be picked up within the same seven-day time frame.</p><br><br>
            <p>Should either of these time limits be exceeded, we will begin to apply storage charges based on the duration of the delay. The fees will be calculated accordingly, and detailed information regarding these charges will be provided upon request. We appreciate your understanding and cooperation in adhering to these guidelines to ensure a smooth logistics experience.</p>
            <p>Additionally, we would like to inform our customers that KamsiExpress reserves the right to decline requests for certain optional services at any time if necessary, even if payment has already been made for those services. Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.</p>
